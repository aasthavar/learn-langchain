Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\n\\n\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\n\\n\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\n\\n\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\n\\n\\nand sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\n\\n\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\n\\n\\nefforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\n\\n\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\n\\n\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\n\\n\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\n\\n\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\n\\n\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\n\\n\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\n\\n\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\n\\n\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\n\\n\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\n\\n\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\n\\n\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\n\\n\\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both\\n\\n\\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\n\\n\\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io\\n\\n\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis . Deep Learning . Layout Analysis\\n\\n\\nCharacter Recognition . Open Source library . Toolkit.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\n\\n\\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification [11,\\n', metadata={'source': 's3://amazon-textract-public-content/langchain/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2\\n\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\n\\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].\\n\\n\\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\\n\\n\\nmanual specification of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\\n\\n\\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\\n\\n\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-\\n\\n\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\n\\n\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\n\\n\\nworks like TensorFlov [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\n\\n\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\n\\n\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\n\\n\\nand many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\\n\\n\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\n\\n\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\n\\n\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\n\\n\\nfull-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\n\\n\\nand fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\n\\n\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use\\n\\n\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\n\\n\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\n\\n\\ndocumented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\\n\\n\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\\n\\n\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\n\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a unified toolkit to support DL-based document image\\n\\n\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\n\\n\\nis built with the following components:\\n\\n\\n1.

Its convenient\\n\\n\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\n\\n\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\n\\n\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will benefit a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\n\\n\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\n\\n\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent efforts for improving DL model\\n\\n\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com-\\n\\n\\nputer vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

Due to\\n\\n\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\n\\n\\nplied to target samples that are significantly different from the training dataset. As\\n\\n\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in different domains, it is important\\n\\n\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples.

In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\\n\\n\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the final\\n\\n\\noutputs.

There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\n\\n\\nthe Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide different\\n\\n\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\n\\n\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.\\n', metadata={'source': 's3://amazon-textract-public-content/langchain/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Currently,\\n\\n\\nthree types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser, shown\\n\\n\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\n\\n\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\n\\n\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\n\\n\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\n\\n\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be specified and a total\\n\\n\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\n\\n\\nlike shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in,\\n\\n\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\n\\n\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\n\\n\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\n\\n\\ntransformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates\\n\\n\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\n\\n\\ndetailed description of these operations\\n\\n\\nBased on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\n\\n\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements.

A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports\\n\\n\\nprocessing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\n\\n\\nlayout structures.

       " Document(page_content='12\\n\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\n\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\n\\n\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\n\\n\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\n\\n\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\n\\n\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\n\\n\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\n\\n\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\n\\n\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\n\\n\\nposition. Errors are identified and rectified via checking the consistency of the\\n\\n\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\n\\n\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19]\\n\\n\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n\\n\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\n\\n\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\n\\n\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\n\\n\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\n\\n\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\n\\n\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\n\\n\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\n\\n\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\n\\n\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The flexible\\n\\n\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\n\\n\\nto their original positions on the page.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\n\\n\\nwith different glyphs, which significantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\n\\n\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special flat font is used for printing\\n\\n\\nnumbers and could not be detected by off-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\n\\n\\nflexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\n\\n\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal effort. As the characters\\n\\n\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\n\\n\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\n\\n\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identifies characters within\\n\\n\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model\\n\\n\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score1 16 and\\n\\n\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.\\n\\n\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\n\\n\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\n\\n\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\n\\n\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate fine-grained\\n\\n\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n\\n\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\n\\n\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\nThis measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\n\\n\\nand lower is better.\\n', metadata={'source': 's3://amazon-textract-public-content/langchain/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Many previous works [26, 30, 27]\\n\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\ntools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\n\\n\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\n\\n\\nfor born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\n\\n\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\n\\n\\nusing the existing resources with minimal effort.\\n\\n\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\n\\n\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\n\\n\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38] from the\\n\\n\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By filtering\\n\\n\\nout model predictions of low confidence and removing overlapping predictions,\\n\\n\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which significantly\\n\\n\\nsimplifies the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\n\\n\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\n\\n\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\n\\n\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\n\\n\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\n\\n\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\n\\n\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at different positions\\n\\n\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from different pages are concatenated,\\n\\n\\nand a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\nhttps://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula\\n', metadata={'source': 's3://amazon-textract-public-content/langchain/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
